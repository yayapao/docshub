**Where to Go from here...**

The [Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/) is a great place to start. It contains references, tutorials, videos, and more.

To learn how to organize and work with Go code, read [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code).

If you need help with the standard library, see the [package reference](https://golang.org/pkg/). For help with the language itself, you might be surprised to find the [Language Spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec) is quite readable.

To further explore Go's concurrency model, watch [Go Concurrency Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs) ([slides](https://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide)) and [Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDDwwePbDtw) ([slides](https://talks.golang.org/2013/advconc.slide)) and read the [Share Memory by Communicating codewalk](https://golang.org/doc/codewalk/sharemem/).

To get started writing web applications, watch [A simple programming environment](https://vimeo.com/53221558) ([slides](https://talks.golang.org/2012/simple.slide)) and read the [Writing Web Applications tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/).

The [First Class Functions in Go](https://golang.org/doc/codewalk/functions/) codewalk gives an interesting perspective on Go's function types.

The [Go Blog](https://blog.golang.org/) has a large archive of informative Go articles.

Visit [golang.org](https://golang.org/) for more.
