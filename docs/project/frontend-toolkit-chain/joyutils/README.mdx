Joyutils is a Javascript library, and which come from my engineering experience.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Node.js 8.0.0+

Choose your favorite package manager:

```bash
# npm
npm i joyutils -D

# yarn
yarn add joyutils -D
```

## Usage

In Node.js:

```js
import { geuuid } from 'joyutils'

const uuid = geuuid()
```

## FAQ

### Why named export?

1. Module is a namespace. Default export often leads to function/component per file dogma and makes code less maintainable.
2. Interop with commonjs is broken in many cases or hard to maintain.
3. Show me any good language with default exports. It's historical javascriptism.
